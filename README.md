**The Little Lantern**

Once upon a time, in a quiet village nestled between rolling hills, there lived a little lantern named Lumi. Unlike the big, bright street lamps, Lumi was small and flickered softly. Every night, Lumi would hang outside a tiny cottage, hoping to light the way for travelers.

One stormy evening, when the wind howled and the rain poured down, a lost traveler stumbled upon the village. The big street lamps had gone out because of the storm, leaving the village in darkness. But Lumi, despite being small, glowed steadily.

The traveler saw Lumi’s gentle light and followed it to the cottage, where a warm fire and kind people awaited. From that night on, Lumi understood that even the smallest light can guide someone home.
